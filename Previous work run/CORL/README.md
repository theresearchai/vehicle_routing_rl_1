Work in progress

## Setup
For quick setup, download setup.ipynb, upload it to your google drive, and run it in Google Colab (making sure to read the comments)

## Running code
Code is meant to be run in Google Colab, which means that everything must be done through notebooks. Examples for running the attention model code, l2i code, and code for generating initial solutions for use with l2i code are available in the colab_notebooks folder. These notebooks can be used as is, but customization should be relatively feasible.

## Left to do
- Make l2i_evo parrallel
- Maybe Tensorboard use instead of pickled history files
